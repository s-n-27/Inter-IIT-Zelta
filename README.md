# Curating alphas in Crypto Markets

The project was a solution to quantitative finance problem statement in Inter IIT TechMeet 13.0, which involved forming trading strategies in BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT market with proper risk management techniques.

As a solution, we propose an RL agent for BTC/USDT market and exploiting correlation between bitcoin and ethereum for ETH/USDT market.

We were able to beat the benchmark confortably in both the markets, in both in-sample and out-sample testing.
